sphericalpolygon package

This package is an archive of scientific routines for spherical polygons.   
Currently, operations on spherical polygons include:
    calculating area or mass(if the area density is given) and perimeter
    geometrical or physical moment of inertia tensor
    determining whether one or more points are inside the spherical polygon.
