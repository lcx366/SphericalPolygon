sphericalpolygon package

This package is an archive of scientific routines for spherical polygons.   
Currently, operations on spherical polygons include calculating area or mass(if the area density is given), geometrical or physical moment of inertia tensor, and determining whether one or more points are inside the spherical polygon.
